## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a complete regression-based machine learning workflow to predict the **median house value** from housing, population, income, and location-based features.

Users interact with the system through a browser-based interface that collects structured inputs and returns a predicted house price generated by a trained machine learning model.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **California Housing Dataset** (`sklearn.datasets`)
- Target variable: **Median House Value**

The dataset contains numerical features related to income levels, housing characteristics, population density, and geographic location.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

**`california_housing_eda.ipynb`**

* Loaded and inspected the California Housing dataset
* Checked missing values, feature distributions, and correlations
* Analyzed income and geographic features influencing house prices
* Identified skewness and potential outliers
* Used insights to guide preprocessing and model selection

---

## ⚙️ Data Preparation & Preprocessing

**`california_housing_model.ipynb / .py`**

* Performed stratified train–test split based on income
* Applied basic outlier handling
* Built preprocessing pipelines using `SimpleImputer` and `StandardScaler`
* Used `ColumnTransformer` for column-wise transformations
* Integrated preprocessing and models using `Pipeline`

---

## 🤖 Model Building & Evaluation

**`california_housing_model.ipynb`**

* Trained Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
* Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, and R² score
* Used cross-validation to assess generalization
* Selected XGBoost as the final model

---

## 💾 Model Persistence & Deployment

**`california_housing_model.py`, `app.py`**

* Serialized trained pipelines using `joblib`
* Loaded the best model (XGBoost) into a Flask web application
* Served predictions using Gunicorn and deployed on Render
